## Programming exercise - Routing of telephone calls

The main code of the exercise can be found on the ```telephone.rb``` file.
I chose to keep it all in one file for simplicity, and because the classes 
are all very small.

I wrote some test cases to cover some of the requisitions on the exercise 
description while I was writing the classes, and to provide some example of 
how to use them.

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a
terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

In order to run the tests, you can run the test file from the exercise
directory with the following command:

    ruby telephone_test.rb
